# OIBSIP Project 5 – Sales Prediction

This repository contains my submission for Project 5 of the Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship.

## Objective

To build a regression model that predicts product sales based on advertising budgets across different channels: TV, Radio, and Newspaper.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Workflow

1. Imported the advertising dataset and checked for missing values  
2. Performed basic data exploration and statistical summary  
3. Visualized correlation between features using a heatmap  
4. Split the data into training and testing sets  
5. Trained a Gradient Boosting Regressor model  
6. Evaluated model using Mean Squared Error and R² Score  
7. Visualized Actual vs Predicted Sales  
8. Predicted new sales based on sample ad budgets  

## Model Performance

- Mean Squared Error: 0.53  
- R² Score: 0.98  

## Status

Task Completed
